Reflection

What made your assistant “personal” to you?
I named it NikkiBot because I wanted something that actually felt like an extension of me. I added real tasks I needed to handle this week, like studying for my biology quiz and prepping for my UX portfolio. I also gave it moods that shift throughout the day to match my own energy, like starting out motivated, getting tired after heavy work, and ending the day feeling accomplished.

What challenges did you face using this?
Honestly, using `this` inside the methods was tricky at first. I had to keep reminding myself that `this` always refers to the current object instance (in this case, NikkiBot). Once I got the hang of it, things clicked and started making more sense. Managing the task list and keeping track of mood changes in the right order took some experimenting too.

Which method would you improve or expand?
I’d expand the `completeTask()` method so it can accept a specific task name instead of always completing the first one. I’d also love to build in reminders or let NikkiBot react to how many tasks are left, like encouraging me when I’m down to just one. Making it talk to me like a real assistant would be a fun next step.
